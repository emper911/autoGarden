Description: This project is to develop code that can control the production of agricultural produce in hydroponic systems.
Requires needing to define specific variables for inputs (sensors) and outputs (controls) that can be used to monitor plant growth.
Would like to connect systems to the cloud and process data through agrigrating hydroponic IoTs and improve output levels from input history.
