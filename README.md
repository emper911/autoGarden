# autoGarden
This program is used as a timer mechanism for a and hydroponic/aeroponic system controlling lighting and irrigation.
The raspberry pi is used to turn on/off lighting and a water pump. 
Lighting is on for 13hrs and off for 11hrs.
The water pump is set on for 1 minute every five minutes.

There is only one singular button for the system which turns the system on and off. 

Future Improvements:
- To add a temperature and humidity sensor for better monitoring.
- To add other physical buttons capable of changing the motor and lighting times.
- To create software over a network for remote access to the system changing motor timing and light timing
  as well as send information on humdity and temperature.
