#The Program
This program is used as a timer mechanism for a and hydroponic/aeroponic system controlling lighting and irrigation.
The raspberry pi is used to turn on/off lighting and a water pump. 
Lighting is on for 13hrs and off for 11hrs.
The water pump is set on for 1 minute every five minutes.

There are three different buttons.
 - Button 1: Turns on/off the system.
 - Button 2: Changes time that motor is on. 3 different times: 30 secs, 60 secs, or 90 secs on in a 5 minute cycle.
 - Button 3: Changes time that LED is on. 6 different times: 11hrs, 12hrs, 13hrs, 14hrs, 15hrs on in a 24hr cycle.

Future Improvements:
- To add a temperature and humidity sensor for better monitoring âˆš
- To create software over a network for remote access to the system changing motor timing and light timing
  as well as send information on humdity and temperature.
